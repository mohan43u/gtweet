Compiling and installing tweetpts from source
---------------------------------------------

Before compiling, make sure following libraries and their header
files are available in your system (by installing <package>-devel packages).

libglib (http://www.gtk.org/download/linux.php)
libncursesw and libpanelw (http://www.gnu.org/software/ncurses/)
liboauth (http://liboauth.sourceforge.net/)
libcurl (http://curl.haxx.se/libcurl/)
libjson-glib (http://developer.gnome.org/json-glib/unstable/)
libreadline (http://www.gnu.org/software/readline/)

Most of them will be installed already in your system because lot
of packages pulls them as one of their dependency. But make sure their
header files are available. Once they are ready, all you need to do is,

./configure
make
make install
ldconfig

You may have to run the last two steps with root priviledge,

sudo make install
sudo ldconfig
